This project explores Mumbai's Air Quality Index (AQI) data from Kaggle (dataset link). With a background in environmental science and urban planning, our goal is to uncover patterns in air quality to aid city planning and raise awareness.


## Objectives
1. Understanding Trends: Analyze trends in pollutants (NO, NO2, NH3, SO2, CO).
2. City Planning Impact: Provide insights for informed city planning decisions.
3. Raising Awareness: Contribute data-driven insights for public awareness.
